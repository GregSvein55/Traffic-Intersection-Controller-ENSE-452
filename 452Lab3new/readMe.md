Description

This is a new lab 3 I made after attempting Lab 4 and realizing that my original Lab 3 didn't work very good,
so this is my new one that I'm going off in the future so I can complete future labs and the project

This application is a Command-Line Interface (CLI)
that enables users to interact with a target microcontroller 
board. A welcome message is printed by the CLI when it is booted,
and it appears on the screen. Up top the number of commands is displayed
in the static upper window.
In a scrollable window below, the CLI then prints the prompt
"Enter a command for the LED:". A command can then be entered by the user.
If the command was improperly formatted, an error notice is displayed. 
Incorrect typing can be fixed by pressing the backspace key.

Ther are 4 commands:

1. "on" turns the green LED on

2. "off" turns the green LED off

3. "query" prints out the state of the green LED

4. "help" prints all possible commands
