Description: Assignement 4 for ENSE 452,
implements a queue based on a linked list.
My assignment was to implement a function insert that
takes a data element and an integer, and inserts the data
into the queue at the position specified by the integer.

My modifications to the code was adding the overloaded insert funtion in
queue.cpp, and the testInsert function in testq.cpp. All tests pass, I printed 
the test as well just to show that everything works as intended.
